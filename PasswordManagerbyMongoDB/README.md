# Password Manager Project

## Getting Started

This project is a password manager application with a frontend built using React and Vite, and a backend implemented with Express.js. It provides a user-friendly interface for managing passwords securely.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm should be installed on your machine. You can download them from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).

## Configuration

Ensure to configure the backend server URL in the frontend code if it's different from the default `http://localhost:3000`. This can be done by updating the appropriate API endpoint URLs in your frontend configuration.

The backend should now be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Running the Project

- Ensure both the frontend and backend servers are running.
- Open the frontend application in your browser to interact with the password manager.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React with Vite for fast and efficient development and build processes.
- **Backend**: Express.js for handling server-side logic and API endpoints.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:
- Check the console for error messages.
- Ensure that all dependencies are installed correctly.
- Verify that the backend server is running and accessible.
- Confirm that the frontend is correctly configured to communicate with the backend.
